I implemented simulated annealing in a Jupyter notebook to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals.

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Simulated_Annealing.ipynb
